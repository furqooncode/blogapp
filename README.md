#MY CODE ISSUES 
Am creating a blogapp that will allows users to add post, delete their post and I'll also be using news api along with users post on the home page(blog field). Recently i Haven't done any updates with the CRUD part , am still on the SIGNUP page i Haven't implemented my Login Page also for now , basically its only the Signup page that has function for now i.e Its using COCOBASE BAAS Function 
But am having issue with it , if i signup a new user (am using a try catch) to catch the error , it'll only write successfully even when my data is off which isn't supposed to be offline 
if i also go to my COCObase project site , I'll be having failed to fetch
this is my 4th project am creating on it , cause i deleted others that i have there before ,still same 
in the link field i added my localhost link(#http://localhost5173), still not working, getting failed to fetch 
but if i create a new project without using it in my code (project id and api key) everything works fine
